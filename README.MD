MoodleDownloader (https://github.com/dmanser92/MoodleDownloader) downloads all your resources from your Moodle Account to your configured Destination.
Just fill in the login URL to your Moodle-Site, your username and password in the config.ini.

### Features:
* Updates your Folder, downloads only what's not there yet
* Downloads the resources with the right titles
* Downloads folders as well

Inspired by https://github.com/vinaychandra/Moodle-Downloader, but this uses Python3 and handles the moodle-site differently.
